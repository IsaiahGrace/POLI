# Polymorphic Obfuscation Logic Implimentation (POLI)
### Isaiah Grace, John Martinuk, Brain Graves

## Branches
These are the branches planned at the moment:
- master
- apb_slave <- Isaiah
- control_register <- Isaiah
- CRC_control <- John
- NAND_NOR <- John
- XOR_BUF <- Brian

## Design Log
 1. What have you done recently? (Post interesting plots or schematics or photos)
 2. What will you do before the next progress check?
 3. What are you unsure about?
